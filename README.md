# react-native-drax
A drag and drop system for React Native

## Status
This library is in pre-release status. Documentation and extensive examples will be coming.

For now, here are two simple Snack examples:
- [Basic drag and drop](https://snack.expo.io/@lafiosca/react-native-drax---basic-drag-and-drop?platform=ios)
- [Basic reorderable list](https://snack.expo.io/@lafiosca/react-native-drax---basic-reorderable-list?platform=ios)

Note: these Snack examples do not work in the Web device, only in the iOS and Android devices.
